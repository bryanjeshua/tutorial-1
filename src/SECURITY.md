# Security Guidelines and Policies

## Introduction
Welcome to the security guidelines and policies for my Eshop project. Security is of utmost importance to us, and we appreciate your cooperation in maintaining the integrity and safety of our software.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing bryanjmt04@gmail.com. We request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Guidelines
- Follow secure coding practices outlined in our development guidelines.
- Always validate and sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.
- Use strong encryption for sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- Implement appropriate access controls and authentication mechanisms.
- Regularly update dependencies and third-party libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Code of Conduct
We expect all contributors to adhere to our code of conduct, which promotes respectful and inclusive behavior. This includes interactions related to security discussions and reporting.

## Security Releases
Security updates will be released as soon as fixes are available. We will follow semantic versioning for releases, and detailed release notes will be provided to inform users of the changes.


## External Dependencies
Before adding or updating dependencies, ensure that they are reputable and actively maintained. Regularly monitor for security advisories and promptly apply updates as needed.

Thank you for your commitment to the security of our project!
